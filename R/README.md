# R Projects  
Created by Lindsay Chu. 

## Transit Cost Project Analysis  
`R Studio`, `data visualization`, `data wrangling`, `graphing`, `correlation`, `PCA`

*Created for the course SDS375: Data Visualization in R*

This project focuses on analyzing the `transit_cost` dataset, originally compiled by the Transit Cost project and posted on GitHub repository, tidytuesday. 

For my analysis, I focus on two questions: 
1. Which are the top 10 countries for number of projects, and what are their distributions in terms of cost (in millions) per kilometer?
2. Are there any significant relationships among the numeric variables, and can the dataset be reduced to smaller dimensions to better understand such relationships?

## Credit Card Usage Analysis
`R Studio`, `data visualization`, `data wrangling`, `clustering`, `PCA`, `predictive modeling` 

*Created for the course SDS322E: Elements of Data Science*

This project uses the `credit_card_data.csv` dataset from Kaggle (link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata).) 

For my analysis, I perform a variety of R statistical techniques, including PAM clustering, regression modeling, and Principal Components Analysis (PCA).
