As Membership Officer for Texas AMA, I was the first to create an interactive database to facilitate tracking of dues owed/paid, registration to National AMA (so members can participate in workshops and competitions), and events attendance. This system not only centralizes data from various Google Forms, but also helps the officer board assess member engagement and interests in order to tailor events accordingly. 

For confidentiality purposes, the rows use numeric ids for member names, emails, etc.

*Created for the School of Design and Creative Technologies (SDCTx)*

I served as the principal data analyst for a design research project aimed at providing digital tools and assistance to Texas universities during COVID-19. 
I curated and managed an Excel database of 190 universities and acquired info of over 200 faculty members to contact about their online teaching experiences. I also obtained data from course evaluation reports, university news articles, and Texas Higher Education almanacs to ensure accurate, representative sampling.

For confidentiality purposes, the sheets containing faculty names and other PII are hidden.

I also created a Tableau version of my analysis, link [here](Tableau/README.md).
