# SPSS Projects  
Created by Lindsay Chu. 

### Behavioral-Based Segmentation: An Empirical Analysis of the Food Delivery Market
`market research`, `customer segmentation`, `hierarchial clustering`, `principal components analysis (PCA)`

This project was created for my Spring 2021 course, MKT360: Information and Analysis, with the following objectives:   
* Identifying the most lucrative market segments that GrubHub should target in order to maximize their growth potential and increase their market share.
* Segmenting users into distinct clusters and identify any variations in motivational factors between segments through **cluster and factor analyses.**

I led the research and data analysis, which included:
1. Designing and distributing a Qualtrics survey to UT students regarding food delivery app usage/preferences
2. Pivoting and reformatting survey responses on Excel
3. Performing cluster and factor analyses on IBM SPSS to create customer segments

#### Files
* `FoodDeliveryApps.sav`: The SPSS dataset (converted from an Excel file of survey data from 45 UT students), which I used for running factor and cluster analyses. 
* `MKT360 Final Report.pdf`: The summary of the research.  Includes the survey findings, statistical procedures, and recommendations for GrubHub to increase its market share.   

### Proclivity Model for Hypertension
`factor analysis`, `predictive modeling`, `correlation analysis`

This project was created for my Spring 2021 course, MKT372: Data Analytics for Marketing.  Throughout the semester, I analyzed a health dataset of over 15,000 records and focused my research on hypertension, as this is an incredibly common ailment.  I used factor analysis, regression, and various other methods to develop a **proclivity model that identifies individuals at risk of hypertension.**

#### Files
* `Health_Data_Total`: The SPSS dataset that contains over 15000 records of US individuals and their personal demographics, as well as binary variables for whether or not they have a variety of conditions, such as cancer, insomnia, depression, and hypertension (our research focus).
* `SPSS Proclivity Modeling Project.pdf`: A document that combines the final three lab reports I completed for my class. Includes information on the methods I used for my proclivity model and its potential applications.
